    <h2>What Is Jambalaya? </h2>
    <p>Jambalaya is a one-pot dish that's made with rice, meat or seafood, and vegetables. With French and Spanish infliences, jambalaya is quite similar to paella. The name "jambalaya" likely comes from the Provençal word "jambalaia," which means mishmash. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ cup bacon drippings</li>
        <li>1 cup coarsely chopped celery</li>
        <li>1 large onion, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>1 large green bell pepper, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 pound andouille sausage, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the roux: Whisk together flour and 3/4 cup bacon drippings in a large, heavy saucepan over medium-low heat until smooth. Cook roux, whisking constantly, until it turns a rich mahogany brown color. This can take 20 to 30 minutes; watch heat carefully and whisk constantly or roux will burn. Remove from heat; continue whisking until mixture stops cooking. </li>
        <li>Make the gumbo: Place celery, onion, green bell pepper, and garlic into the work bowl of a food processor, and pulse until all vegetables are very finely chopped. Stir vegetables into the roux, and mix in sausage. Bring mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat, and cook until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside. </li>
        <li>Combine water and beef bouillon cubes in a large Dutch oven or soup pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir until bouillon cubes dissolve, then whisk roux mixture into the boiling water. </li>
